	<h2>Veev Panel Prototype</h2>
	<ul>
  <li>Prototype built with <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> processing javascript library.</li>
  <li>Reference for functionality only, not visual design.</li>
  <li>Toggling developer mode hides overlaid annotations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Functionality Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Touching and dragging anywhere in the devices column begins adjustment take over. Including the whole column as a potential touch area requires less precision and increases usability.</li>
<li>We need a good way to differentiate between this touch and drag gesture, on/off taps, and page swipes. </li>
<li>The first touch establishes the touch-origin and moving away from that point adjusts the setting from its current position. </li>
<li>Each Column has has a “Decrease Zone” (denoted in yellow in developer mode), which when a drag falls into this zone the adjustment behavior is reversed with the setting decreasing when moving away from the touch-origin and increasing as you move back towards it.</li>
<li>Also of note, the drag distance needed to reach 100% and fill the circle is smaller than the radius or the circle. The distance you drag and the percentage it increases should not be 1:1 and this ratio will probably be something we would like to tune in final testing.
